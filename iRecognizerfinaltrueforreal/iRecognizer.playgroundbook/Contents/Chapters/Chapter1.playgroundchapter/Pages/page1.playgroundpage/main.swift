 # Introduction
 
 Hello there, fellow WWDC Swift Student Challenge reviewer! On the back of the iPad you're most likely holding right now, what do you see? The Apple logo, the iPad wordmark, the Smart Connector, and of course, the camera module.
 
 
  We have come so far along in camera technology it is hard to imagine life without them. Using the power of Swift and it's various APIs and technologies, let me take you on a trip on the history of cameras on Apple devices.
  
  
  # IMPORTANT NOTE:
  Please disable "Enable Results" in the menu with a speedometer icon next to the "Run My Code" button. The code renders incorrectly and sometimes doesn't work at all with the option enabled.
