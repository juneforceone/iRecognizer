/*:
 # Macintosh 128k photography capabilities (or lack thereof)
 The first Mac's photography capabilities were nil, zip, nada. It had no built-in camera of any kind, so there were no photos or videos that were avaliable to capture.
 
 # Run the code :)
 The image on the right would be what the Macintosh 128k sees, just a pure empty void.
 
 Let's go to the next page to see one of the first MacBooks with a camera.
