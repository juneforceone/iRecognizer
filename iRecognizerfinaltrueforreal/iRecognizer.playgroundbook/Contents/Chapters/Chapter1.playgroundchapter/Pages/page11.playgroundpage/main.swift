 # iPad Pro capabilities
 The iPad Pro added the popular ultra-wide from the iPhone 11, and added a brand new LiDAR scanner, short for Light Detection And Ranging, it sends invisble light beams to nearby surfaces and measures the time it takes for it to bounce back to the iPad, accurately capturing the depth and how far away an onject is, for better and more instant AR experiences.
 
 # Run the code :)
 
 On the next 2 page are 2 short demos showcasing the power of the LiDAR scanner, Core ML, and the Vision frameworks.
 
You guessed it! It's time to go to the demo pages!
